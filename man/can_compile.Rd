\title{Test if compilation is possible}
\usage{
can_compile(verbose = FALSE, skip_cache = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Be verbose when running commands?}

\item{skip_cache}{Try again to compile, skipping the cached value?}
}
\value{
A logical scalar
}
\description{
Test if compilation appears possible.  This tries compiling a
trivial C program with \code{R CMD SHLIB} (using
\code{\link{rcmdshlib}}).  Results are cached between runs within
a session so this should be fast to rely on.
}
\details{
If this function believes you can't compile, and if \code{gcc}
can't be found on the path, a diagnostc message will be printed.
This will of course not be very interesting if you use a different
compiler to gcc!  But the most likely people affected here are
Windows users; if you get this ensure that you have rtools
installed.  If you have \code{devtools} installed,
\code{devtools::find_rtools()} may be helpful for diagnosing
compiler issues.

\examples{
can_compile() # will take ~0.1s the first time
can_compile() # should be basically instantaneous
